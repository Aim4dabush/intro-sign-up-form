## Overview

This a project that is part of a series called "16 Front-End projects to help improve your coding skills". It is a project that focuses on form validation.

### Goals

- Recreate an exact replica of the landing page
- Create form validations for all inputs
- Design the validation errors like the examples that are given

### What I learned

I learned a lot about conditional rendering to control when the error messages are displayed. I later edited my validation after learning about `custom hooks`. The reason why I edited it using custom hooks is because I noticed that a lot of validation were repeating the same operation and custom hooks cleaned up the code a lot more.
